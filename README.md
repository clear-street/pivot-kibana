This repository holds Flexmonster Pivot plugin for [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana).

## Requirements

The version of Kibana should be compatible with Elasticsearch. For more details, check [support matrix](https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix#matrix_compatibility). 

## Step 1: Install Flexmonster Pivot plugin

Navigate to Kibana `bin/` folder and run in the console:

```bash
kibana-plugin install https://github.com/flexmonster/pivot-kibana/releases/download/v7.3.0/flexmonster_clst-v7.3.0.zip

cd plugins/flexmonster_pivot
yarn upgrade
```

## Step 2: Enable CORS for Elasticsearch 

Open `elasticsearch.yml` and add the following configuration:

```bash
http.cors.enabled : true
http.cors.allow-origin : "*"
http.cors.allow-credentials: true
http.cors.allow-methods : OPTIONS, HEAD, GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
http.cors.allow-headers : kbn-version, Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, Engaged-Auth-Token, Content-Length, Authorization
```

## Step 3: Enable CORS for Kibana

Open `kibana.yml` and add the following configuration:

```bash
elasticsearch.hosts: ["http://localhost:9200"]
server.cors: true
server.cors.origin: ['*']
```

## Step 4: See the results

A new tab with Flexmonster Pivot will be available if you open Kibana:
